## What is World Atlas?

World Atlas is a geographical word game. You have to enter names of the places in the world according to some rules. It focuses on how much geographically strong you are. 
## How to play World Atlas?

The player who wins the coin flip/toss(or anything you can call) gets the chance to enter(tell) the place first.
After the player A has entered the place the  player B has to then enter   the place whose first letter begins with the last letter of player A's place.
Lets say player A said "New York" then the Player B has to say a place beginning from "K" ,after this same applies for Player A and so on.
This continues for the next player as well if it is a game of more than two players.
Anyone who cannot think of a valid and non-repitative place,loses.
There might some things to be discussed before the game starts like how much lives a player has ,the standard is 1 but it can be modified as per players preferance.
