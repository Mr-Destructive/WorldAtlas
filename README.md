# WorldAtlas
A fun geographical game. 
A game that can ignite a interest in geography... The subject which is hated by most of the people. 
The instructions are simple.. 
1) enter your name 
2) then the computer will randomly choose one of the players.. Either you or computer
3) if it's you then you have the freedom to choose any place on earth (not small as a town).
Or if it's computer it will choose any random place and give it to you. 
4) then if it was you who entered the first place then the computer must type the place with the last letter of your entered place. 
Or if computer was first then you have to type the name of place with starting with the  last letter of comp's place. 
5) this continues till anyone runs out (printing wrong place.. Typos are not allowed.. No repetition)
